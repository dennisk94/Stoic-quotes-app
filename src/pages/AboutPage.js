                The goal of this application is to provide curious individuals or practitioners of the Stoic philosophy a space to explore the knowledge and wisdom Stoicism offers. This app is intended for anyone, but particularly for those who lack self-esteem and/or experience heightened levels of anxiety. 
            </p>
            <p className="about-why">
                The inspiration for this app stems from my own personal struggles with anxiety and self-esteem. The stoic philosophy has helped me bounce back from some of the experiences I went through since the initial Covid-19 shutdown.
